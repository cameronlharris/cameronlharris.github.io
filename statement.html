			<h1>Encounters with the (im)material</h1>
			<br>
			<p class="blocktext">This exhibition explores the way in which the material and immaterial are</p>
			<p class="blocktext">connected in the museum through the interrelations between artworks, artists,</p>
			<p class="blocktext">curators, audiences and ideas. Artworks are the material expression of artist's</p>
			<p class="blocktext">ideas. Traces of how artworks are created are one way the relation between </p>
			<p class="blocktext">the artist and their thoughts is made visable. Curators propose ways of</p>
			<p class="blocktext">interpreting artworks by creating relationships between them in exhibition</p>
			<p class="blocktext">spaces. Audiences come to their own interpretations of art by engaging with the</p>
			<p class="blocktext">meanings that artworks hold for them, as well as the ideas presented through</p>
			<p class="blocktext">the curators' arrangement. By embodying meanings about the imaginary, social</p>
			<p class="blocktext">and spiritual worlds, artworks collapse notions of the material with the</p>
			<p class="blocktext">immaterial.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="blocktext">Artworks from the Wits Art Museum holdings that explore matter, spirituality,</p>
			<p class="blocktext">agency, and music are included in order to pose questions about what art is, and</p>
			<p class="blocktext">how we might understand the relationship between the seen, the invisible, and</p>
			<p class="blocktext">the audible. Multiple audiences' roles in making meanings from their encounters</p>
			<p class="blocktext">with artworks is foregrounded in this exhibition.</p>
